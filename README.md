Timelapseish for audio files
============

Python script to condense audio files (.wav) in timelapseish way. Allows nice audio tricks and studying of the form of the piece.
This is quite a naive script, it introduces some unintended pops as well.  

Requires numpy and scipy installed.  

The whole process runs in memory, so obviously the maximum length of the audio file is determined by the amount of memory available. Shortish symphonies are possible.  
  
Use mono files!
